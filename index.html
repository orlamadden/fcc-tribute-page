                <p>A tribute page to some of Super Mario's best bits .
                </p>

                <h3 class="pt-4">1. Super Mario Bros. 3 (1990)</h3>
                <p>Many will argue about the greatest all-time Mario game, and sure, it’s tough to judge–but it’s almost impossible to deny that Super Mario Bros. 3 is the most enduring success of the Mario franchise, and perhaps, the greatest video game of all time, too. As Nintendo rose into cultural significance and launched this title, Super Mario became a broader, more intricate, and more complex series, providing players with hours upon hours of adventure, and hopping to new worlds never before captured in the medium. It changed the game. And, the raccoon tail was pretty cool, too. </p>

                <h3 class="pt-4">2. Super Mario 64 (1996)</h3>
                <p>The game that completely changed video games still feels as fresh as ever, almost 25 years later. Many titles from its time tried to imitate and recreate the magic of Super Mario 64, the first full-blown 3D platformer, but none quite achieved the childlike sense of wonder that this marvelous game inspired. </p>

                <h3 class="pt-4">3. Super Mario World (1990)</h3>
                <p>Capes! A stunning new color palette! Completely new character designs for the whole gang! Super Mario World was the last of the classic side-scrolling Mario titles, but by no means the least significant. Everything from the iconic soundtrack to the Koopa children made this game one of the most important titles in the history of the medium. </p>

                 <h3 class="pt-4">4. Super Mario Galaxy 2 (2010)</h3>
                <p>The sequel to Galaxy took the already stellar series to soaring new heights by adding Yoshi and some tougher gameplay mechanics. It was odd to see a straight sequel to a modern 3D Mario game, but this one really made the case that all successful Mario games deserve a full-fledged follow-up. Now, when are we getting Super Mario Odyssey 2? </p>

                <h3 class="pt-4">5. Super Mario Odyssey (2017)</h3>
                <p>The most recent 3D Mario platformer is also one of the all-time greatest. Odyssey helped Nintendo achieve its victory lap on the Switch by recapturing that sense of adventure we all knew and loved from Super Mario 64. The developers took a huge risk by adding the new Cappy mechanic, but it really paid off in this instant-classic of a title. </p>
